<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many great exercise apps available online, however, our team didn't find one that really suit our needs so we created this enhanced one. We want to create a fitness app so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- We think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on doing amazing things. A workout that gets you sweating and the heart pumping
* You shouldn't be doing the same exercises over and over like pushups or dumbbell curls
* You should implement Fitness App principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one fitness app will serve all workout styles since your needs may be different. So we'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this fitness app!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
